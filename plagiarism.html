        <h2>Understanding Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism, often described as intellectual theft, involves using someone else’s work, ideas, or
            expressions without proper acknowledgment. It is a serious ethical offense in academic,
            professional, and creative fields, as it undermines originality and violates the principles of
            integrity and fairness. While many understand the basic definition of plagiarism, the nuances,
            consequences, and preventive measures are often overlooked.
            Plagiarism is a serious offense that has led to significant consequences for various individuals
            across different sectors. Below are some notable reported cases of plagiarism and the resulting

            These cases reflect how plagiarism, whether accidental or deliberate, can lead to significant
            professional and personal consequences, including loss of credibility, career setbacks, and public
            backlash. The severity of the punishment often depends on the individual’s status and the context
            in which the plagiarism occurred.

            The punishment for plagiarism and intellectual property (IP) violations varies across different
            countries, reflecting their legal systems, cultural attitudes toward creativity, and the importance
            they place on protecting intellectual property. While there are common trends, the specific
            penalties and enforcement mechanisms differ depending on national IP laws. Here&#39;s an overview
            of the nature of the punishment for plagiarism and IP violations in different countries:
