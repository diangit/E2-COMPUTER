            Malware and Cybersecurity
        </h2>
        <p>
            Malware, short for malicious software, is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or cause
            damage to a computer. This can include viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more.
            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These
            attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from
            users; or interrupting normal business processes.

                <p>
                    A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates by inserting copies of itself
                    into other computer programs, data files, or the boot sector of the hard drive. Once this
                    replication
                    succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.

                <h2>Ransomware Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or
                    perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the
                    system
                    so that it is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a
                    technique called cryptoviral extortion.

                <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames,
                    passwords, and credit card details, by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic
                    communication. Typically carried out by email spoofing, instant messaging, and text messaging,
                    phishing
                    often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website that matches the look and feel
                    of
                    the legitimate site.

                    Spyware is software that aims to gather information about a person or organization without their
                    knowledge, that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, or that
                    asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge.
